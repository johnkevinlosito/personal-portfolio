          I&apos;m a passionate developer, currently focused on the frontend. I
          am naturally curious, always seeking new knowledge, and actively
          developing new skills.

          The technologies I work with are JavaScript, HTML and CSS with a focus
          on the frameworks React.js, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. I&apos;ve also
          worked with backend technologies such as PHP, Laravel, and MySQL.

        <p className="my-4 text-lg">
          When I&apos;m not coding or taking a break, you&apos;ll often see me
          casually playing video games, and binge-watching movies, TV series,
          and anime.
