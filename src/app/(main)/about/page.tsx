          I'm a passionate developer, currently focused on the frontend. I am
          naturally curious, always seeking new knowledge, and actively
          developing new skills.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          The technologies I work with are JavaScript, HTML and CSS with a focus
          on the frameworks React.js, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. I've also worked
          with backend technologies such as PHP, Laravel, and MySQL.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          When I'm not coding or taking a break, you'll often see me casually
          playing video games, and binge-watching movies, TV series, and anime.
