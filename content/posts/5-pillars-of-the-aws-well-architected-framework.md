**Pillars:**

1. Security
2. Reliability
3. Performance Efficiency
4. Cost Optimization
5. Operational Excellence

**Security Pillar**

- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Detective controls
- Infrastructure protection
- Data protection
- Incident response

  - **Design Principles**

    - Implement security at all layers
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply principle of least privilege
    - Focus on securing your system
    - Automate security bbest practices

**Reliability Pillar**

- Recover from issues/failures
- Apply best practices in: (Reliability in the cloud 3 areas)

  1. Foundations
  2. Change management
  3. Failure management

- Anticipate, respond, and prevent failures

  - **Design Principles**

    - Test recovery procedures
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Scale horizontally
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation

**Performance Efficiency Pillar**

- Select customizable solutions
- Review to continually innovate
- Monitor AWS services
- Consider the trade-offs

  - **Design Principles**

    - Democratize advanced technologies
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use a serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Have mechanical sympathy

**Cost Optimization Pillar**

- Use cost-effective resources
- Matching supply with demand
- Increase expenditure awareness
- Optimize over time

  - **Design Principles**

    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Reduce spending on data center operations
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure
    - Use managed services

**Operational Excellence Pillar**

- Manage and automate changes
- Respond to events
- Define the standards

  - **Design Principles**

    - Perform operations as code
    - Annotate documentation
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operations prcedures frequently
    - Anticipate Failure
    - Learn from all operational failures
